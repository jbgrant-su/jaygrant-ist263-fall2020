For my individual project, I plan to make a portfolio website showcasing filmmaking and photography. Content:* I plan to have a homepage with a very brief introduction of myself and a few examples of most recent work.* A page for photography, where I will have photos and descriptions for each collection.* A page for films, including descriptions and credits.* A more in-depth ‘about me’ page, including areas of focus, software and equipment used, and past experiences and work.
