            <h2>Skytop Quarry // Art of Camoflauge</h2>
            <p>This collection is from a hike I took with my roommate Wilson at the Skytop Quarry in Syracuse, New York, in the winter of 2020. I liked how the pink of his jacket popped from the otherwise whitewashed scenery.</p>

            <h2>Winooski Quarry // Time Flies By</h2>
            <p>This collection is from a cliff jumping trip with my friend Liam in Winooski, Vermont, in late summer of 2020. The deep teal of the water compliments the deep gold of the sun on his skin.</p>
